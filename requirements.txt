Player view info filtering

Action history

n>2 Players

Zones
    - card zones
    - player zones

Cards
    - compile time guarantees from macros?
    - procedural macros to enable automatic effect ids?

Determinism
    - random seeding initial state
    - game state hashing
    - f(s, a) = s'
    - Replayability
        - Initial state + list of actions = State N
        - expand initial 'state + actions' into individual game states for efficient history browsing

game history browser
    - move between states recorded in the game's history

game states database
    - input hash gets a game state
    - serialization of game states and actions

Optimizations
    - computed fields (lazily computed as needed per state)

Objects
    - have identifiers
    - targetable, target filtering

Effects
    - target objects
