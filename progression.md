# Algomancy - Progression

A full description of the progression of a game of algomancy, including stage, steps, phases, and priority windows.

## Setup Stage
This stage handles the setup of the game. This includes the decision of setting up the game in 'new-player' mode 
and the selection of which decks to include in the game deck.

### New Player Mode

Lets the players decide together on whether they want a new-player experience.

### Faction Selection

There are a few ways to select factions. 
The players should eventually end up with three factions selected, greater/fewer can be selected, just not zero.

- player agreement
- randomly
- veto system with dice

The players also may decide their neighbors, i.e. seating location. Or perhaps this is random.

The players may also agree to custom rule modifications such as starting life. Though it's not going to be supported 
initially. 

### Player Preparation

This is a mode primarily for the paper version of the game. However, it can be encoded in the digital client for 
completeness. It handles dishing out initial draft decks, mana converters, a random player is assigned initiative, 
the tokens and resources are set up in the play area.

Once this stage is over, the game is ready to begin (move to play stage).
